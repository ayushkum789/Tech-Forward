# Authentication

The Movies API currently does not require authentication for development purposes.

## Future Authentication

In production, the API will support:

- API Key authentication
- OAuth 2.0
- JWT tokens

## Security Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Keep API keys secure
- Never commit credentials to version control
